You can put BBEdit text filters in the `Text Filters` folder of your BBEdit configuration folder (`~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Text Filters`) unless you've moved your configuration directory to Dropbox).

1. Put them in the appropriate folder
2. (Re)start BBEdit

You can also assign keyboard shortcuts to each of the filters from BBEdit's preferences (**Menus & Shortcuts** &raquo; **Text** &raquo; **Apply Text Filter**). The "control" combinations are largely unused in BBEdit (with the exception of control-s, which is used for progressive search).

Finally, you can make the filters appear at the top of the Filters menu by prepending `00)` to the filename of each.
